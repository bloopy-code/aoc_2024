# aoc_2024 👽🐍

Attempting to keep track of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/)


Pre-Challenge Goals:
- Try with built-in packages and libraries only first
- Stick to the end!
- Spend some time trying in some other languages too

## Progress

| Day | Completed | Stars | Comments |
|-----|-----------|-------|----------|
|Day 1 - Historian Hysteria | ✅ 01/12 | ⭐⭐ |Completed with 1 built-in library. Could be done maybe better with NumPy.<br>Rating: 😺 Easy|
|Day 2- Red-Nosed Reports | ✅ 02/12 | ⭐⭐ | Completed with 2 built-in libs. Not ultra efficient, but it works!<br>Rating: 😺 Easy|
|Day 3 - Mull It Over | ✅ 03/12 | ⭐⭐ | Simpler than yesterdays one, but feel like wasn't very effective/pythonic with part 2.<br>Rating: 😺 Easy|
|Day 4 - Ceres Search | ✅ 08/12 (Part 1), 09/12 (Part 2) | ⭐⭐ | Thought the diagonals were the tricky part, but you have to READ the prompt, Bloopy! Also feels very messy code. Had to enlist some help 💞👯<br>Rating: 😾 A bit tricky!|


## Notes & Reflections
- [ ] give a try in another language
- [ ] sort out gitignore and requirements
