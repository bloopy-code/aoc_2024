# aoc_2024 👽🐍

Attempting to keep track of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/)


Pre-Challenge Goals:
- Try with built-in packages and libraries only first
- Stick to the end!
- Spend some time trying in some other languages too

## Progress

| Day | Completed | Stars | Comments |
|-----|-----------|-------|----------|
|Day 1 - Historian Hysteria | ✅ 01/12 | ⭐⭐ |Completed with 1 built-in library. Could be done maybe better with NumPy.<br>Rating: 😸 Easy|
|Day 2- Red-Nosed Reports | ✅ 02/12 | ⭐⭐ | Completed with 2 built-in libs. Not ultra efficient, but it works!<br>Rating: 😸 Easy|
|Day 3 - Mull It Over | ✅ 03/12 | ⭐⭐ | Simpler than yesterdays one, but feel like wasn't very effective/pythonic with part 2.<br>Rating: 😸 Easy|
|Day 4 - Ceres Search | ✅ 08/12 (Part 1)<br>09/12 (Part 2) | ⭐⭐ | Thought the diagonals were the tricky part, but you have to READ the prompt, Bloopy! Also feels very messy code. Had to enlist some help 💞👯<br>Rating: 😾 A bit tricky!|
|Day 5 - Print Queue | ✅ 09/12 (Part 1)<br>12/12 (Part 2) | ⭐⭐ | Part 2 takes a little while, very inefficient. Part 1 was easy enough, still overall easier than Day 4. Not rating easy because solved very inefficiently.<br>Rating:😾 A bit tricky!| 
|Day 6 - Guard Gallivant | ♒ 23/12 (Part 1)<br>❌ Part 2 | ⭐ | Part 1 took me a lot of thinking and research to do, Part 2 I can't think of any way to do it that won't take 10 million years. Brain not braining. Will revisit later!<br>Rating: 🙀 Hard! |
|Day 7 - Bridge Repair | ✅ 29/12 | ⭐⭐ | Not so bad, but need to remember to <b>READ THE WHOLE BREIF</b>. Tripped up on two minor things from not thinking properly, and overcomplicated Part 2 initially. Takes a while due to not coding very efficiently, which appears to be a running theme of mine so when all Days are complete, may revisit to beat times!<br>Rating: 😺 Easyish|


## Notes & Reflections
- [ ] give a try in another language
- [ ] sort out gitignore and requirements
- [ ] Go back and see if can make code more efficient and robust (errors, typing, general efficiency)
